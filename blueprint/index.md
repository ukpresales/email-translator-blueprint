* [Requirements](#requirements "Goes to the Requirements section")
* [Implementation steps](#implementation-steps "Goes to the Implementation steps section")
* [Additional resources](#additional-resources "Goes to the Additional resources section")

## Solution components

* **Genesys Cloud** - A suite of Genesys cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. You deploy the Email Translator solution in Genesys Cloud.
* **Genesys AppFoundry** - The Genesys app marketplace for solutions that run on the Genesys Cloud platform. You download the integration used in this solution from the Genesys AppFoundry.
* **Interaction Widget integration** - The Genesys Cloud integration that enables web apps to be embedded in an iframe within Genesys Cloud. The iframe only appears on specified interaction types and to specified agents. For this solution, Genesys Cloud uses the Interaction Widget integration to show translated email messages to the customer.
* **AWS IAM** - Identity and Access Management that controls access to AWS resources such as services or features. In this solution, you set the permissions to allow the Email Translator to access Amazon Translate and the AWS SDK.
* **Amazon Translate** - A translation service that enables cross-lingual communication between users of an application. Amazon Translate is the translation service used in the Email Translator solution.

### Software development kits (SDKs)

* **Genesys Cloud Platform API SDK** -Client libraries used to simplify application integration with Genesys Cloud by handling low-level HTTP requests. This SDK is used for the initial email interaction between agent and customer.
* **AWS for JavaScript SDK** - This SDK enables developers to build and deploy applications that use AWS services. This solution uses the JavaScript API to enable the Email Translator in an agent's browser and it uses the inside Node.js applications to enable the Email Translator on the server where Genesys Cloud runs.

       }
     }
  ```

### Host and run the Node.js app server

1. At a command line, verify that you are running Node.js v14.15.4 or later. Open a command line tool and type `node-v`.
  * To upgrade, type `nvm install 14.15.4`.
  * To install the latest version, type `npm install -g n latest`.


2. Switch to the directory where the files for your Email Translator project are located and install the dependencies in the local node-modules folder. In the command line, type `npm install`.
3. To run the server locally, in the command line type `node run-local.js`.

### Set up an email interaction

1. Log in to your Genesys Cloud organization and add a domain if you do not already have one.
2. Add an email address to the domain.
  * Under Email Routing, select the queue you specified when you [installed and activated the Email Translator](#install-and-activate-the-email-translator-in-genesys-cloud "Goes to the Install and activate the Email Translator in Genesys Cloud section").

For more information, see [Send and receive emails directly with the myPureCloud.com domain](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/send-and-receive-emails-directly-with-the-mypurecloud-com-domain/ "Opens the Send and receive emails directly with the myPureCloud.com domain article") in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.

### Test the solution

1. To start an email interaction as a customer, send an email to the email address you configured earlier.
   ![Send email](images/send-email.png "Send email")
2. To answer the email as an agent, in your Genesys Cloud organization change your status to **On Queue** and then answer the incoming interaction.
  ![Email interaction](images/email-interaction.png "Incoming email interaction")
3. To open the Email Translator, click the **Email Translator** button which appears in the agent's toolbar.
4. Upon loading the Email Translator, the agent can see a message bubble with the translated message from the customer.

  :::primary
  **Tip**: The **Copy** button translates the agent's response into the customer's language and adds the translated response to the clipboard. The agent can then paste the translated response in the email response window before sending it.

  The **Send** button sends the agent's translated response to the customer and ends the interaction.
